Installing
====================================

Installing is not easy. It is recommended you have basic PHP knowledge before proceeding.

First of all PHP greater or equal 5.3 is recommended.
PHP's extension mbstring and PDO drivers are required.
PHP's variable register_globals is required to be off.
PHP's variable magic_quotes_gpc is required to be off, see also
	http://www.php.net/manual/en/info.configuration.php#ini.magic-quotes-gpc

PHP packages:
	cURL: Updating usernames and converting accounts from local to bzbb
	GD: Gallery
	mbstring: multibyte strings
	mysql: PDO driver for database connectivity


You need to set up four configuration files
	CMS/siteoptions_path.php: file that shows the code where the old world config resides.
				  A template is available at CMS/siteoptions_path_example.php
	siteoptions.php: The old world config. This file should not reside in the webserver dir.
					 It is also required to be readable by PHP.
					 A template is at CMS/siteoptions_example.php
	CMS/classes/settings_path.php: file that shows the code where the actual config resides.
								   A template is available at CMS/classes/settings_path_example.php
	settings.php: The actual config. This file should not reside in the webserver dir.
				  Also it is required to be readable by PHP.
				  A template is at CMS/classes/settings_path.php

You may use the examples to modify them. :)
	cp siteoptions_path_example.php siteoptions_path.php
	cp settings_path_example.php settings_path.php
Note that in this example commands it is assumed you would use the default path in siteoptions_path.php
	cp siteoptions_example.php ../../siteoptions.php
	cp settings_example.php ../../settings.php

Now you need to set up the relational database management system.
At the moment only using mysql is possible.

A database structure dump can be found in bz-owl.sql within this directory.
To avoid concurrent access and performance issues it is recommended to use a database only for this league software.

It is highly recommended to use a BBCode library. See the CMS/nbbc-wrapper.php example file.

This software uses extensive URL-rewriting.

apache2 :
Use either htaccess.suggested or setup similar rewrite rules.

lighttpd:
url.rewrite-if-not-file = (
"^/path/to/web/(js|themes|Flags|Matches|Players|Teams|Visits|Servertracker)/.*" => "$0",
                "^/path/to/web/\?(.+)" => "/path/to/web/index.php?path=/&$1",
                "^/path/to/web/(.+)\?(.+)" => "//path/to/web/index.php?path=$1&$2",
                "^/path/to/web/(.+)" => "/path/to/web/index.php?path=$1" )

Otherwise here are rewriting guidelines:
¥ You must not rewrite URI's pointing to an existing directory or file except if it points to a path within the CMS directory or the CMS directory itself.
¥ You must rewrite all URI's pointing to any directory within the CMS directory or the CMS directory itself.
¥ You must rewrite the URI's the following way: call web/index.php?path=PATH/TO/FILE/RELATIVE/TO/WEB/DIR/WITHOUT/../OR/./AND/QUESTION-MARKS/CHANGED/TO/AMPERSAND/

Updates
-----------

By using svn up you should get a new version of the source code, if available.
However the database structure and the required settings may have changed. We provide an updater between major stable versions in Utilities/bz-owl-db-updater.php (requires command line php installation). Most settings of config are not stored in database but as a file that probably needs manual updating. You may use bz-owl's reference settings as default values for new config keys.

If you upgrade your BBCode library it is recommended to run the bbcode-library-updater.php (requires the website to be in the web dir) but keep in mind this will break legacy data in the database.
