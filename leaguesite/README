====================================

This project is a lightweight CMS that serves as tool to provide a non-static website. Its name is derived from the game BZFlag and is an abbreviation for BZFlag Open Web League.

In essence it consists of a loader that loads an add-on for almost any address. The add-ons handle the output and are supposed to be programmed to fit the need.

Target audience: People with PHP/MySQL and Apache2 or Lighttpd experience who want to host a website.
