Information for bz-owl developers
====================================

bz-owl source code lives in the following directories:

often re-used code
------------
CMS/			- the central storage for important files
CMS/classes		- very commonly used classes
CMS/add-ons		- installed add-ons, they handle pretty much everything
CMS/themes		- installed theme templates, controlling html output
themes			- installed theme css and javascript - directly accessed by end user without URL rewriting
CMS/maintenance		- old maintenance script to clean and to update the database, partly still used

pages in navigation
------------------------
*/			- source code of the page in navigation, usually with same name
index.php	- home page

"other stuff"
-------------
rss/		- exporting data to 3rd party sites

Note that only a few directories contain code directly related to the
game BZFlag.  In particular: CMS/bzbb_login and Servertracker.

Coding conventions
==================

If you plan on contributing any source code to this website, we would like
you to follow certain conventions.  Contributions that don't conform are
likely to be ridiculed and rejected until they do.

Code Organization
-----------------
PHP files use the .php extension. Javascript files use the .js extension.
References in the outputted markup must not include the extension.
If you link to Login/index.php the produced link in the (X)HTML must point to Login/ and NOT to Login/index.php.

Formatting
----------
Everybody has their own style and has things they don't like about any
other style.  Well, we can't have a zillion styles in the code, so
follow this league website style if you want your contribution included.  The
source code serves for examples of the following rules.

  1)  Indents are done using tabs. The tab width is 4.

  2)  The opening brace of all blocks goes on the following line after the
      statement introducing it.  The closing brace is indented
      like the statement except for functions where it aligns with the
      open brace.  For example:

	void foo()
	{
		for (;;)
		{
			if (expr)
			{
				// comment
				code
				
				more code
			}
		}
	}

  3)  An else clause goes on the following line (there are many unacceptable
      alternatives):

	if (expr)
	{
		
	} else
	{
		
	}

  4)  Defines names are all capitals, class names have the first letter
      of each word capitalized, all other names have the first letter
      of each word except the first capitalized.  Only macros may use
      underscores, except for in the names of method parameters where
      a leading underscore is allowed to make it different from a
      member variable.

  5)  Put spaces after statements followed by expressions and spaces
      around operators.  For example:
	if (a == b)
      not
	if(a==b)

  6)  Do not leave old commented code hanging around and do not submit
      patches with "// Added by foo on xx" comments.  This is what
      version control software is for.

 10)  Do not code very long lines.  Try to stay within 90 columns if
      possible, but don't go over 130 if you should raise that limit
      for some reason.

Violations of these rules in the existing code are not excuses to
follow suit.  Non-conforming code may be fixed.  Patches to
non-conforming code should follow the non-conforming code's style if
following the rules would cause an ugly mess.

Performance
-----------

If the code you are editing is in a performance-critical section of
the code (that is, if it is called very often, you should profile the
proposed changes.  The new code does not necessarily need to be
faster, but a quantitative analysis is required.


Committing Changes
==================

Make atomic changes in a way that a system will be working, or at least
will compile successfully, before and after committing a set of changes.

Try to separate out bigger commits into smaller ones.  In particular,
if a change involves multiple functionality changes, the commit should
be broken up into smaller coherent chunks.  This way if a bug or other
issue with a particular commit is later encountered, the change can be
more easily isolated and undone or fixed.

Making Patches
--------------

If you do not have source code commit access and would like to propose
a change for inclusion, you should create a patch.  Patches should be
submitted to the current maintainer:

http://code.google.com/p/bz-owl/

You can create a patch for submission from a source
checkout using the following command:

svn diff > my_patch_name.diff

If your patch requires the addition of new files, simply include these
new files individually or in a tarball as part of the patch submission.

In general, patches should be relatively small succinct changes that
can be readily reviewed, tested, and applied.  Patches that are
difficult to review, test, or apply will likely not be accepted.  That
said, creating useful patches that have been discussed with the
existing developers is one of the more immediate means to become a
developer for this league website yourself.

Licensing
---------

By committing to a source code repository or submitting a patch, you
the developer are giving the project maintainer (Thomas Stauer), and his
successors various rights to the work submitted, as defined below.

Grant of Copyright License.
Each Contributor hereby grants to The Project Maintainer a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly
display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and
such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

Grant of Patent License.
Each Contributor hereby grants to The Project Maintainer a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except
as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use,
offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where
such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such
Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s)
alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to
which such Contribution(s) was submitted.  If the Contributor
institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or
contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
the Contributor under this License for that Work shall terminate as of
the date such litigation is filed.

Submission of Contributions.
Any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by
Contributors to the Project shall be under the terms and conditions of
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with
Licensor regarding such Contributions.

Notes.
As the original author you may distribute, modify, transfer, and
relicense your copy of a submitted work as you see fit, provided it
does not have additional licensing restrictions from being a derived
work.  You may not place any restrictions on how the project
maintainer maintains or handles your submitted works.
Works that are derivations of existing works in the project are
subject to the current project license ("modified LGPL").  Authors that submit
works must have the legal right to agree to these terms, either as
original author or authorized licensee of derived works.

Testing
=======
You should, of course, test if your changes do work before committing changes.


Sounds
======
Do not use sounds.


Images
======
Images are stored as portable network graphics (.png).  Compression is
okay, but no additional options such as interlacing.


Making a Release
================
In order to make a release, there are handful of steps that need to be
taken.  If any step fails to be completed successfully, the release
cannot proceed.  A checklist of items to be completed follows:

- All code is committed to the repository.

- NEWS includes a comment for all items added since the previous
  release, preferably denoting who made what changes.

- Version numbers are updated to the next expected release number.

- Tag the release.  Tag format should be consistent with the other
  tags using the format of vMAJOR_MINOR_RELEASE
