short term:

* Fix PM send (welcome message) to new user at login.

* Convert existing features to use Smarty before adding new features.

* Cached Smarty templates must not contain per-user information, such
  as PMs.  http://www.smarty.net/docsv2/en/caching.multiple.caches.tpl
  contains more information about this.  We use the player's user ID
  where they have $my_cache_id in the examples on that page.

* Thorough testing with multiple accounts should reveal problems.

* Add web interface to manage the database CMS table, which controls
  which add-on should be used for which page.

* Move leaguesite installation instructions from README to INSTALL.

* Focus on 42 theme for now and update other themes after the overall
  framework is set.


long term:

* Merge Osta's Ducati League features.

* Restructure to support multiple leagues with a single web site.

* As much as possible should be implemented as add-on.

* More themes!

* Drop legacy siteoptions.php (old code depends on that file).

* Merge database `news` and `bans` tables by adding a new `page`
  column.  This will make it easier to add other news-style pages.
  Will need a process to convert existing databases.
