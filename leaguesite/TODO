until next release:

* Private messages, news and static pages must work as good as in the last release.

* Maintenance code was specific to old DB version, must be updated.

* DB updater script must work flawless.

* Be able to edit a news entry without changing timestamp of the news.

* Verify PM send (welcome message) to new user at login.

* Make sure users with empty password entry in players_passwords get updated
  to new accounts upon using bzbb login automatically

short term:

* Convert existing features to use Smarty before adding new features.

* Cached Smarty templates must not contain per-user information, such
  as PMs.  http://www.smarty.net/docsv2/en/caching.multiple.caches.tpl
  contains more information about this.  We use the player's user ID
  where they have $my_cache_id in the examples on that page.

* Thorough testing with multiple accounts should reveal problems.

* Add web interface to manage the database `CMS` table, which controls
  which add-on should be used for which page.

* Move leaguesite installation instructions from README to INSTALL.

* Focus on 42 theme for now and update other themes after the overall
  framework is set.
 
* Move CMS tree and other files that are not direct URL targets out of
  the web tree.

* Add error handling, especially for database queries.
 
* Fix BZFlag external login cookie in upstream weblogin.php so it
  preserves the canonical upper and lower case of callsigns.  Bullet
  Catcher will get this done.


long term:

* Merge Osta's Ducati League features.

* Restructure to support multiple leagues with a single web site.

* As much as possible should be implemented as add-on.

* More themes!

* Drop legacy siteoptions.php and siteinfo.php (old code depends on that).

* Add add-on options to admin web interface.

* Remove any hardcoded URL from code.

* Add database support for ban management, including reason, start,
  and end.  When a ban ends, automatically send a reminder PM to
  admins for re-adding the player to spawn group.

* Add a dynamic "tasks" page for all admins and/or referees that
  shows things such as matches to be entered, bans to be lifted, spawn
  requests.  Allow annotations for spawn requests.

* The time zone for the `last_activity` column in the `online_users`
  table is wrong.  When the local time offset is UTC-7 hours the
  timestamps in the column are UTC+7 hours.  This isn't critical
  because the same incorrect offset is used when comparing the current
  time with stored timestamps.  (Should set the configured timezone as
  early as possible in all pages, perhaps in index.php.)
