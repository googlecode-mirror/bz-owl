Installing
====================================

Installing is not easy. It is recommended you have basic PHP knowledge before proceeding.

First of all PHP greater or equal 5.3 is recommended.
PHP's variable register_globals is required to be off.
PHP's variable magic_quotes_gpc is required to be off, see also
	http://www.php.net/manual/en/info.configuration.php#ini.magic-quotes-gpc

PHP packages:
	cURL: Updating usernames and converting accounts from local to bzbb
	GD: Gallery
	mbstring: multibyte strings
	mysql: PDO driver for database connectivity


You need to set up four configuration files
	CMS/siteoptions_path.php: file that shows the code where the old world config resides.
				  A template is available at CMS/siteoptions_path_example.php
	siteoptions.php: The old world config. This file should not reside in the webserver dir.
					 It is also required to be readable by PHP.
					 A template is at CMS/siteoptions_example.php
	CMS/classes/settings_path.php: file that shows the code where the actual config resides.
								   A template is available at CMS/classes/settings_path_example.php
	settings.php: The actual config. This file should not reside in the webserver dir.
				  Also it is required to be readable by PHP.
				  A template is at CMS/classes/settings_path.php

You may use the examples to modify them. :)
	cp siteoptions_path_example.php siteoptions_path.php
	cp settings_path_example.php settings_path.php
Note that in this example commands it is assumed you would use the default path in siteoptions_path.php
	cp siteoptions_example.php ../../siteoptions.php
	cp settings_example.php ../../settings.php

Now you need to set up the relational database management system.
At the moment only using mysql is possible.

A database structure dump can be found in bz-owl.sql within this directory.
To avoid concurrent access and performance issues it is recommended to use a database only for this league software.

It is highly recommended to use a BBCode library. See the CMS/nbbc-wrapper.php example file.

This software uses extensive URL-rewriting.

apache2 :
Use either htaccess.suggested or setup similar rewrite rules.

lighttpd:
url.rewrite-if-not-file = (
"^/path/to/web/(js|themes|Flags|Matches|Players|Visits|Servertracker)/.*" => "$0",
                "^/path/to/web/\?(.+)" => "/path/to/web/index.php?path=/&$1",
                "^/path/to/web/(.+)\?(.+)" => "//path/to/web/index.php?path=$1&$2",
                "^/path/to/web/(.+)" => "/path/to/web/index.php?path=$1" )

Otherwise here are rewriting guidelines:
¥ You must not rewrite URI's pointing to an existing directory or file except if it points to a path within the CMS directory or the CMS directory itself.
¥ You must rewrite all URI's pointing to any directory within the CMS directory or the CMS directory itself.
¥ You must rewrite the URI's the following way: call web/index.php?path=PATH/TO/FILE/RELATIVE/TO/WEB/DIR/WITHOUT/../OR/./AND/QUESTION-MARKS/CHANGED/TO/AMPERSAND/

Updates
-----------

By using svn up you should get a new version of the source code, if available.
However the database structure and the required settings may have changed. We provide an updater between major stable versions in Utilities/bz-owl-db-updater.php (requires command line php installation). Most settings of config are not stored in database but as a file that probably needs manual updating. You may use bz-owl's reference settings as default values for new config keys.

If you upgrade your BBCode library it is recommended to run the bbcode-library-updater.php (requires the website to be in the web dir) but keep in mind this will break legacy data in the database.
